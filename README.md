# fincen
Fincen (Financial crimes enforcment network) BSA data transmission methods for the the BSA E-Filing System

A go library for reading and writing Fincen BSA forms. It is capable of generating, validating, and batching submissions.

The project is Fincen which is a financial reporting for the United States. There are many forms that are required in this project but we will start with SAR(Suspicious activity report). I would like a go library that creates the structs to build and validate the SAR form. It also needs to be able to export the file to XML.

In the future we will wrap the service with json/http services so that it can work as a web service and not just a go library.
New project
https://github.com/moov-io/fincen/blob/master/README.md

We will end up with a sub project for each of the form parsers. This is all of the forms.

The final phase of the project will be a service that collects fillings and then on a scheduled time will batch the fillings and submit them electronically.
